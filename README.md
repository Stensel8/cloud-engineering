# Public Cloud Concepts

## Under Development

This repository is **under development** and serves as a learning resource for an HBO (Higher Professional Education) school module on Public Cloud Concepts. This is part of a structured learning path I'm following during my studies.

**Please note:** This is educational material and should not be considered production-ready. Do not rely on this for critical applications. The solutions, configurations, and implementations presented here are learning exercises and may contain simplifications, errors, or incomplete implementations.

## About This Project

This repository documents my progress through various cloud computing topics and modules covered in my HBO studies. As I progress through different subjects and weeks, I will be adding more content, examples, and configurations.

## Learning Path Structure

- **Week 1**: Container fundamentals and basic Kubernetes deployments
- **Week 2**: Service management and ingress configurations

More weeks will be added as the coursework progresses.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress for educational purposes. The code, configurations, and documentation may change significantly as I advance through the curriculum. Please use this as a reference for learning, not as a production-ready template.
